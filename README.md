# Goals & What I've Learned
 
This year I wanted to expand my Rust experiences with data-structures, complicated cases with string parsing, and how 
memory is managed in Rust. Although I've written a Gameboy emulator it was a relatively simple project when it came to 
appeasing the borrow-checker; this left me with a huge hole in my knowledge.

Here are "lessons learned" for each day's problems.

> **SPOILER WARNING**  
> There will be solution spoilers in these notes.

## Day 1

My original solution involved sorting the calorie listing then taking the max value. There's a faster way to obtain 
a max value using the `k_largest` algorithm which uses a binary heap to keep the maximum value at the root of the heap.
Here's a stack overflow discussion of this: 

[What is the advantage of heaps over sorted arrays?](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/63931/what-is-the-advantage-of-heaps-over-sorted-arrays])

Rust's Itertools crate will provide this soon, for now I am using a PR branch to obtain this functionality.

## Day 2

Strings are slow when we have guaranteed ASCII char input! The original solution used lots of `&str` references for 
matching the Rock / Paper / Scissor puzzle inputs. I converted these over to `&[u8; 1]` and got a nice boost. You can 
see the code differences in this commit:

(Optimization - &str to chars commits)[https://github.com/itwasscience/aoc_2022/commits/main/src/bin/02.rs]

**Comparison of runtimes**
```
----------
| Day 02 |
----------
üéÑ Part 1 üéÑ
15523 (elapsed: 206.60¬µs) -> (elapsed: 45.60¬µs)
üéÑ Part 2 üéÑ
15702 (elapsed: 204.40¬µs) -> (elapsed: 41.50¬µs)
```

## Day 3

I used a similar optimization to Day 2 here and treated the inputs as ASCII and used a simple byte -> priority mapper
to just do some integer math to find rucksack item priorities.

## Day 4

My first solution used a `for x in foo { if ... else }` style of code to sum values to a mutable variable within the
loop. I rewrote this later to use the `filter()` and `count()` methods, which resulted in cleaner code.

(Cleanup Commit)[https://github.com/itwasscience/aoc_2022/commit/0ad3344e85c777b2db0712266d1b78d8e9e0da2c]

## Day 5

This day had a real tricky issue in the helper function I wrote to build the `Vec<VecDeque<char>>` up from the puzzle 
input. Observe the following code snippet which is trying to iterate over some input line-by-line and update a Vector 
with some function using that line's contents:

```rust
fn parse_line(input: &str) -> char {
    input.chars().nth(0).unwrap()
}

fn main() {
    let input = "a\nb\nc\nd\n";

    let mut broken = Vec::new();
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            broken.push(parse_line(line));
        });
    println!("Broken: {:?}", broken);

    let mut working = Vec::new();
    input
        .lines()
        .for_each(|line| {
            working.push(parse_line(line));
        });
    println!("Working: {:?}", working);
}
```

What's happening here? I'm using CLion with the Rust plugin and the recommendation from the plugin is `Unused Map<Lines,
fn(&str)> that must be used` and recommends I prefix the first block of input parsing with `let _ =`. Doing this will
NOT fix the issue with this code. Why?

In Rust iterators are evaluated in a lazy fashion. This means that `map` will only do work when the iterator is advanced
either by calling `next` explicitly or via something like `collect()`. Just an assignment will not cause the iterator to
be evaluated; instead the type of the _ would have been of the type `Map<Lines<fn(&str)>>`.

What does the compiler say? 
```
   = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
   = note: iterators are lazy and do nothing unless consumed
```

Unfortunately this message goes away using the plugin's recommendations but won't solve the issue!

There's two obvious ways to fix this issue. The less-elegant is to leave the `let _ =...` and then force an evaluation
with `.collect::<Vec<()>>()` (just a vector of the _unit_ type). Thankfully we can also use the `for_each()` method to
force an evaluation of the Iterator and avoid requiring collection entirely (and the `let _ =` statement).

## Day 6

Day 6 gave me the opportunity to check out some neat windowing functions in the Itertools crate. There really wasn't 
else to this day.

## Day 7

Day 7 posed the first real datastructure work. Although the puzzle was conceptually fairly simple it lent itself to a
_tree_ datastructure. Rust's borrow-checker gave me quite a bit of trouble here as my typical Pythonic solutions quickly
broke due to one particular borrow-checker rule:

> **Borrow Checker Error**  
> error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time

My initial tree structure was something like this:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Directory<'a> {
    file_sizes: usize,
    children: Vec<&'a mut Directory<'a>>
}

impl <'a> Directory<'a> {
    fn sum(self) -> usize {
        let mut sum = self.file_sizes;
        for child in self.children {
            sum += child.sum();
        }
        sum
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut child_a = Directory{file_sizes: 1, children: Vec::new()};
    let mut child_ab = Directory{file_sizes: 2, children:  Vec::new()};
    let mut child_ac = Directory{file_sizes: 3, children: Vec::new()};
    let mut root = Directory{file_sizes: 10,  children: Vec::new()};

    root.children.push(&mut child_a);
    child_a.children.push(&mut child_ab);
    child_a.children.push(&mut child_ac);
    root.sum();
}
```

But does this work? During the problem it became clear I would need to traverse this structure in a recursive fashion to
take sums of nested directories. This `sum` function quickly explodes:

```rust
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*child` which is behind a mutable reference
--> src/main.rs:11:20
|
11 |             sum += child.sum();
|                    ^^^^^^-----
|                    |     |
|                    |     `*child` moved due to this method call
|                    move occurs because `*child` has type `Directory<'_>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
|
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `*child`
--> src/main.rs:8:12
|
8  |     fn sum(self) -> usize {
    |            ^^^^
```

What can we do here? 

The answer is to use something called an _arena_ to map our paths. I choose to use a HashMap since 
I had a known key I could use (the directory path) although `Vec` or other structures may work.

### Theory Behind Arenas

An arena is a structure that holds a reference to a particular node in the tree. Nodes will use a reference to the 
location of other nodes in the arena structure, such as a key or an offset, instead of a direct reference to another 
node.

Here is a tiny excerpt from my day 7 solution demonstrating the arena model:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

/// The filesystem is a tree structure using an arena allocator hashmap with the keys as directory
/// paths. Directories hold the key indexes of child directories.
type DirectoryTree = HashMap<String, Directory>;

#[derive(Default, Debug)]
pub struct Directory {
    file_sizes: usize,
    children: Vec<String>,
}

/// Sums the filesystem recursively for a path.
pub fn sum_path(path: &String, filesystem: &DirectoryTree) -> usize {
    let mut sum: usize = filesystem.get(path).unwrap().file_sizes;
    for child in &filesystem.get(path).unwrap().children {
        sum += sum_path(child, filesystem);
    }
    sum
}

pub fn main() {
    let mut arena = DirectoryTree::default();

    let mut root = Directory{file_sizes: 10,  children: Vec::new()};
    let mut child_a = Directory{file_sizes: 1, children: Vec::new()};
    let child_ab = Directory{file_sizes: 2, children:  Vec::new()};
    let child_ac = Directory{file_sizes: 3, children: Vec::new()};

    // Children are arena keys, NOT references to the children themselves.
    root.children.push("a".to_string());
    child_a.children.push("ab".to_string());
    child_a.children.push("ac".to_string());

    // Build up the Arena with some Strings as the key to the HashMap
    arena.insert("root".to_string(), root);
    arena.insert("a".to_string(), child_a);
    arena.insert("ab".to_string(), child_ab);
    arena.insert("ac".to_string(), child_ac);

    println!("Sum: {}", sum_path(&"root".to_string(), &arena));
}
```

This works great! Notice that the summing function doesn't require any mutable references at all!

> **Optimization?**    
> There might be some room for improvement here if `sum_path()` is being called on very large, very deep trees since the
> recursive calculation has to be done each time `sum_path()` is called. Another `Hashmap` could be used to provide a 
> cache based on the search string for long-running programs. I didn't observe an improvement in Day 07. Always 
> benchmark "optimizations" and remove them if they don't actually deliver benefit for the increased complexity!
